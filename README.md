# RPMS Adapter for CareWeb Framework
This project allows the CareWeb Framework to run on top of the Indian Health Service [Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS)](http://www.ihs.gov/rpms/).  It is pre-configured to run on the  [FOIA GOLDB database](http://sourceforge.net/projects/foiarpms/)  (not provided), but can be run on other RPMS distros as well.  The installation of a KIDS build (cwf.kid) is required.

The project includes a Java port of the Medsphere RPC broker and integrates broker-based security with
the Spring Security framework.

The project also includes several clinical plugins, some fully functional while others are in the early
stages of development.
